## 📋 Conversion Methodology

### How Dutch Universities Convert Grades:

1. **Nuffic Standards:** Dutch universities use Nuffic (Dutch organisation for internationalisation) conversion standards
2. **Percentage-Based:** Often convert to percentage first, then to Dutch 1-10 scale
3. **Holistic Evaluation:** Most universities evaluate holistically, not just GPA
4. **Subject-Specific:** Some universities (like TU/e) place heavy weight on specific subjects (Math, CS)

### Iranian to Dutch Conversion Formula:

**Approximate Formula:**
- Iranian 20-point scale → Dutch 10-point scale
- **Dutch Grade ≈ (Iranian Grade / 20) × 10**
- **Or:** **Dutch Grade ≈ Iranian Grade / 2**

**Examples:**
- 20/20 (Iranian) ≈ 10/10 (Dutch) = Excellent
- 16/20 (Iranian) ≈ 8/10 (Dutch) = Very Good
- 14/20 (Iranian) ≈ 7/10 (Dutch) = Good
- 12/20 (Iranian) ≈ 6/10 (Dutch) = Satisfactory

3. **Competitive vs. Minimum:** Minimum requirements may differ from competitive requirements

5. **Verify Always:** Always verify current requirements on official university websites
